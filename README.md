# Spelling_Bee_Helper
Spelling Bee Helper for the NYTimes Daily Puzzle

Created by jwillis1010 --> https://github.com/jwillis1010
in order to help solve the daily NYTimes Spelling Bee Puzzle @ https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee

Disclaimer 1: I am not associated with the NYTimes. I'm just a reader who got frustrated trying to find the answers.

Disclaimer 2: Yes, this is cheating. I got bored and decided to write something up to help me solve the riddle.

Disclaimer 3: I don't know Ruby all that well and I'm sure this program can be done in 2 lines of code.

Disclaimer 4: The program produced all the answers for the daily puzzle correctly. Tested on 11/25/18.

Thank you to all the contributors of the dwyl/english-words github project
The dictionary used came from them --> https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

Thanks to the Oxford dictionaries for making an API available for free/public use.

Future Improvements:
1. Use Dictionary.com API to verify the answers.
2. Optimize.
3. Use more dictionary files.

To run
1. Download the dictionary file from the github project listed above. Set the name and path in line 27 of the program.
2. Set the letters of the daily puzzle in the "letters" array (line 28 of the program).
3. Set the letter that must be included in all the words as per the puzzle (line 36 of the program).
